Can be difficult to establish how much progress has been made on the puzzle, as scholars may disagree on what has been "solved" or what still needs explainin</td><td style=''></td><td style=''>Example of progressive coherence: Although the role of emotions in social movement organizations has been studied before (Aminzade & McAdam, 2002; Eyerman, 2005; Goodwin & Jasper, 2006; Jarvis, Goodrick, & Hudson, 2019), we know little about the process by which social entre- preneurs can deal with or get beyond negative emo- tions to convince targeted supporters to enact their cause and support their organizations, even when doing so is difficult. As Jasper (2008: 106) noted, “responses to moral shocks vary greatly. Most peo- ple, in most cases, resign themselves to unpleasant changes. But others, through complex emotional processes that few researchers have described, chan-nel their anger into individual and collective activity.” To address this issue, our research question fo-cuses on how social entrepreneurs use visual images and textual interactions to influence their targets to enact a difficult cause. (Barbera-Tomas et al 2019)

Example of noncoherence: There is a lack of agreement about whether a model and a theory can be distinguished, whether a typology is properly labeled a theory or not, whether the strength of a theory depends on how interesting it is, and whether falsifiability is a prerequisite for the very existence of a theory (Sutton and Straw, 1995).</td></tr>

</td><td style=''>Intertextual Coherence from above applies here as well

On Genre - Zuckerman
No warrant puzzle: Theory is either more limited than previously thought or was applied inappropriately based on faulty theoretical assumptions. 

Clarifying Confusion: Resolves misunderstandings in the theoretical framework by identifying key assumptions that have been misinterpreted or applied incorrectly

False Debate: Suggests that a long-standing debate is actually based on a misunderstanding, often reconciling what seemed like conflicting viewpoints. 

Alt Hypotheses: Introduces a new explanation that rivals the dominant theory. Often requires fewer assumptions or explains additional pattern 

Extending Theoretical Scope: applies a well-established theory to a previously unexamined empircal pattern or setting, thus broadening its applicability </td><td style=''>Example of extending theoretical scope: Our theory builds on recent research emphasizing categorization as one of the fundamental social processes that shape the dynamics of industries (Durand & Vergne, in press; Hsu, 2006; Hsu & Grodai, 2015; Jones, Maoret, Massa,

</td><td style=''>Nahapiet & Sumantra (1998) "The particular capabilities of organizations for creating and sharing knowledge derive from a range of factors, including the special facility organizations have for the creation and transfer of tacit knowledge (Kogut & Zander, 1993, 1996; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995; Spender, 1996); the organizing principles by which individual and functional expertise are structured, coordinated, and communicated, and through which individuals cooperate (Conner & Prahalad, 1996; Kogut & Zander, 1992; Zander and Kogut, 1995); and the nature of organizations as social communities (Kogut & Zander, 1992, 1996). However, notwithstanding the substantial insights we now have into the attributes of organizations as knowledge systems, we still lack a coherent theory for explaining them. In this article we seek to address this gap and to present a theory of how firms can enjoy what Ghoshal and Moran (1996) have called "the organizational advantage.""</td></tr>

Rest of the 2nd paragraph:
Identify this unresolved issue and explain its importance, going beyond simply stating that it hasn’t been addressed before. Examples of acceptable reasons for addressing a theoretical issue include:
Articulating important empirical implications of a theory
Identifying implications of a theory’s boundary conditions
Explaining how relaxing a theory’s assumptions change implications
Discussing the implications of one theory for another theory.</td><td style=''>Nahapiet & Sumantra (1998) "Our theory is rooted in the concept of social capital. Analysts of social capital are centrally concerned with the significance of relationships as a resource for social action (Baker, 1990; Bourdieu, 1986; Burt, 1992; Coleman, 1988, 1990; Jacobs, 1965; Loury, 1987). However, as Putnam (1995) recently has observed, social capital is not a unidimensional concept, and, while sharing a common interest in how relational resources aid the conduct of social affairs, the different authors on this topic have tended to focus on different facets of social capital."</td></tr>

It concludes that X has an impact on Y.” Highlight a few important implications of the answer.</td><td style=''>Greenwood et al. (2011) "Given that organizations experience complexity to varying degrees, it follows that they will differ in how they might respond. These responses are important because they can have major implications for social legitimacy and thus an organization’s access to critical resources. Organizational survival may even be at stake. Further, responses to highly incompatible prescriptions or demands will inevitably prioritize some interests at the expense of others.
