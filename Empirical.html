However, in support of foundational theories, we find that cognitive novelty (a patent that originates a new topic) is associated with local search. At the same time, we show that novel ideas tend to have higher economic value. This suggests an alternative model of innovation, where novelty is one source of economic value produced by innovators who “draw on a single domain in a practiced manner” (Taylor and Greve, 2006: 727), while the recombination of distant or diverse knowledge positively influences economic value but reduces the likelihood of cognitively novel breakthroughs. Few patents in our study were both cognitive and economic breakthroughs (less than 1% of our sample), but they appear to have a greater impact on future innovation than any other kind of invention."</td></tr>
