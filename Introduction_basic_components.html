    <tr>
      <td>1. Contextualize the Research</td>
      <td>Provide the background for the research, situating it within the broader academic field. This involves introducing the topic, explaining why it is important, and placing it within ongoing conversations in the field.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Keep this section broad and accessible, providing enough context for readers unfamiliar with the topic. Avoid getting bogged down in specifics or technicalities—focus on the "big picture."</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2. Define the Research Gap</td>
      <td>Identify the gap in the existing literature that your research addresses. Explain why this gap is important, how it impacts the field, and why addressing it is necessary.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Be specific about the gap you're addressing. Frame it as an unresolved issue that needs attention. Avoid vague statements like "no research has been done." Instead, be precise about what's lacking.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3. Justify Your Contribution</td>
      <td>Demonstrate how your research will fill the identified gap. Explain what makes your research unique, including the data, methodology, or theoretical approach. Make the case for why this research is timely and necessary.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Clearly communicate what makes your study novel. Highlight any unique data, methodology, or context, and explain why this work is needed now (timeliness).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4. State the Research Question</td>
      <td>Clearly articulate the main research question that your study seeks to answer. This should distill the problem into a focused, actionable, and empirical inquiry.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Ensure your research question is specific, focused, and researchable, directly addressing the gap in existing literature. Phrase it clearly and simply, and make sure it is feasible to answer within the scope of your study.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4. Frame Your Solution</td>
      <td>Provide a preview of your empirical findings or the solution your research offers. This section should give a concise outline of your research’s contributions, leading the reader toward the main body of the paper.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Avoid overselling. While you want to hook the reader, focus on a high-level preview of your solution without going into too much detail—this is a roadmap, not the final argument.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5. Articulate Theoretical Contribution</td>
      <td>Explain how your research contributes to existing theories and knowledge in the field. Discuss whether your research challenges, extends, or confirms previous theoretical frameworks.</td>
      <td>NaN</td>
      <td>Tip: Position your research as a contribution to the broader academic discourse. Explain whether it extends, challenges, or refines existing theories, and emphasize its theoretical relevance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Practical Relevance (Optional)</td>
      <td>If applicable, explain the real-world significance of your findings. This section is more relevant for applied research, where the practical impact of your work on policy, industry, or practice is emphasized.</td>
      <td>This research has important implications for policy-makers considering automation as a solution for industry efficiency. The findings suggest that training programs could mitigate potential negative impacts on the workforce.</td>
      <td>Tip: Only include this section if it’s relevant. Focus on the potential real-world impact of your research on policy, industry practices, or societal implications, making sure it’s linked to your findings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Preview the Journey (Optional)</td>
      <td>Briefly outline the structure of the paper, showing how each section contributes to answering the research question. This step is useful for longer, more complex papers.</td>
      <td>The paper is structured as follows: Section 1 introduces the background and research question; Section 2 reviews the literature on automation and labor markets; Section 3 presents the methodology; Section 4 discusses the findings; and Section 5 concludes with recommendations for future research.</td>
      <td>Tip: Use this if the paper is complex. It helps the reader understand how the various sections fit together. However, ensure it’s brief—don’t go into excessive detail, just an overview.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ensure Alignment with Conclusion</td>
      <td>Make sure that the research questions and objectives presented in the introduction align with the conclusions. Ensure coherence between the introduction and conclusion to signal rigorous, focused research.</td>
      <td>The conclusion reiterates the main findings, confirming that worker satisfaction improves with automation when accompanied by job training, addressing the initial research question regarding automation's impact on employment.</td>
      <td>Tip: Consistency is key. Your introduction should set up expectations that are addressed in the conclusion. Double-check alignment to avoid leaving open questions or loose ends.</td>
