A practical lesson is that platform designers need to pay special attention to sellers in relatively isolated regions in order to fully achieve their design objectives. Our findings also contribute to current understanding of digital inequality and of the socioeconomic consequences of algorithms (e.g., DiMaggio & Hargittai, 2001; Hansen & Reich, 2015; Lambrecht & Tucker, 2019). An algorithmic change can potentially—and unexpectedly—disadvantage a particular segment of the population due to variation in partici_x0002_pants' local environments. It is important to examine the “offline interface” through which a platform's participants gather, interpret, and act upon online information."</td><td style=''>Not sure if this is for theory papers given intended audience?</td></tr>
<tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Subvert or Reaffirm Expectations</td><td style=''>Kaplan Vakili (2015) SMJ "In this field, we find that, consistent with tension theories of creativity, distant and diverse recombinations are positively associated with economic value as measured by patent citation rates. However, in support of foundational theories, we find that cognitive novelty (a patent that originates a new topic) is associated with local search. At the same time, we show that novel ideas tend to have higher economic value. This suggests an alternative model of innovation, where novelty is one source of economic value produced by innovators who “draw on a single domain in a practiced manner” (Taylor and Greve, 2006: 727), while the recombination of distant or diverse knowledge positively influences economic value but reduces the likelihood of cognitively novel breakthroughs. Few patents in our study were both cognitive and economic breakthroughs (less than 1% of our sample), but they appear to have a greater impact on future innovation than any other kind of invention."</td><td style=''>Stine et al (2015) AMR "This article extends the existing literature to
 provide a more complete picture of how an in-
 dustry emerges and evolves. First, we suggest
 that the evolution of technological designs and
 categories follows similar patterns of initial di-
 vergence and subsequent convergence. Second,
 we consider technological designs and catego-
 ries simultaneously as integral parts of industry
 emergence, and we identify the mechanisms that
 shape the coevolution of technological designs
 and sociocognitive constructs. Third, we extend
 the well-established literature on technology
 evolution by offering a model that details how
 technological design recombination and design
 competition are influenced by the categories and
 associated labels that stakeholders use to make
 sense of the emerging industry. Fourth, we aug-
 ment the more recent theories of category evolution
 by explicitly theorizing how multiple stakeholders
 create new category labels through linguistic re-
 combination and then select some over others. In
 particular, we suggest that categories and their
 associated labels do not emerge in isolation but,
 instead, are continually shaped by changes in the
 technological designs they are trying t</td></tr>

In Section 2, we discuss the decisions impacted by having better information whether a technology is likely to be a GPT. We describe the state of empirical approaches to identify GPTs and our proposed method in Section 3. We benchmark our method in 
Section 4 and provide an application in Section 5. We summarize and discuss limitations in Section 6. "</td><td style=''>Lumineau et al (2021) Org Sci, "In the following, we start by outlining the historical
background and fundamental technical features of
blockchains, which have important social implications for the governance of collaborations. We argue
that blockchains can be viewed as a type of governance mechanism that is distinct from traditional
contractual and relational governance. Then, we discuss how blockchains’ technical features translate
into significant social implications that blockchains
may bring about, specifically analyzing the interplay between blockchain governance and traditional
governance mechanisms. After pointing to several
important limitations associated with the use of blockchains, we conclude with an agenda of future research
opportunities regarding how blockchains could change
the way collaborations are structured, elucidating why
blockchains deserve further attention from organization
